# Art Classifier

## Summary

This notebook aims to classify images from the Kaggle dataset 'Best Artworks of All Time' using a neural network.  It aims to ask the following questions:

* Who painted this?
* What genre is this?
* What nationality is the artist who created this?

The notebook will start from the setup, data collection and data exploration phases, then move to labeling and dataset creation, then building the neural network model, and finally training the model and making predictions with the model.
